# Interactive-Weather-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-BI
Project Overview

This project is an Interactive Weather Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI to analyze and visualize weather data in a clear and meaningful way. The dashboard provides insights into key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and weather conditions across different locations and time periods.

The main objective of this project is to transform raw weather data into actionable insights using data cleaning, modeling, and interactive visualizations. Users can explore weather trends, compare conditions across regions, and understand seasonal or daily variations through dynamic filters and charts.
